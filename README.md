# Using Aweber API

## About the Script:
The script walks you through the authentication process in a 'setup wizard' style, telling you exactly what you need to do along the way. 
Within minutes, you should be over the authentication hump and developing actual AWeber API calls.

## Prerequisites:
1. The username and password to the active AWeber account which you want to manipulate with your app.
2. An active AWeber Labs account with an app already created.
3. The PHP AWeber client library, installed on your server and accessible by the quick-start script. (You can download the API Library via: https://github.com/aweber/AWeber-API-PHP-Library)

Once you have all the above items with you, just use the script.php file.
